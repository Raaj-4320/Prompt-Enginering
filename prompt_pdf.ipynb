Hon’ble Speaker Sir, I am presenting the Budget proposal for the financial year \\n2024-25 in this esteemed assembly. It is a matter of great pride for all of us that \\ntoday the 10th consecutive Budget of Shri Arvind Kejriwal-led Government is \\nbeing presented in the Delhi Legislative Assembly. I would like to express my \\ngratitude first and foremost to the people of Delhi who have always showered us \\nwith their love, blessings, and trust. \\n \\n2. I would like to personally thank the Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, \\nwho has entrusted me with the responsibility of presenting the budget for the first \\ntime as the Finance Minister in the Delhi Legislative Assembly. Hon. Speaker Sir, \\ntoday, I am not just presenting the budget for 2024-25; I am placing before this \\nassembly the evolving picture of Delhi over the past 10 years. \\n \\n3. Hon’ble Speaker sir, in 2013, when we entered politics, we observed that the \\npeople of Delhi were losing their trust in democracy. They used to vote in \\nelections, but they always had a doubt in their mind about whether their vote \\ncould lead to any change at all. They believed that Governments come and go, \\nleaders come and go, but the life of a common man never changes. The life of \\nthe common man was always filled with sorrow, difficulty, and struggle. When the \\nsalary of a common man was credited on the first day of the month and he gave it \\nto his family, all of them worried about how they would survive the month with \\nsuch a little amount in hand. As the 25th of the month neared, with money getting \\nexhausted, homemakers would get anxious about how the last five days would be \\nmanaged.  \\n \\n4. In a common household, if any member of the family fell ill, the family had to \\neither put their jewelry at stake or even go to the extent of pledging their home to \\nbear the expensive medical bills of private hospitals. An ordinary family also \\nstruggled to educate their children. They sacrificed their needs in order to send \\ntheir children to expensive private schools. After working so hard to educate their \\nchildren, the children often struggled to find jobs. These were the reasons why \\nthe common man had not only lost faith in the Governments but also in their \\nvotes.  \\n \\n5. In such a situation, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal came as a ray of hope for \\nthe people of Delhi. The people of Delhi placed their trust in him. With faith in his \\nhonesty, the people of Delhi elected Arvind Kejriwal as their Chief Minister with a \\nsignificant majority.  \\n \\n6. We all are inspired by the life of Lord Ram, hence we pledged to realize the \\ndream of Ram Rajya in Delhi. It is also written in the Ramcharitmanas  that -  3 \\n  \\nराम राज नभगेस सुनु सचराचर जग माǑहं। \\nकाल कम[ सुभाव गुन कृत दु:ख काहु Ǒह नाǑहं॥ \\n \\n7. Meaning-  \"In the reign of Lord Ram, sorrow arising from time, action, nature, and \\nqualities do not befall anyone.\" And it is to realize this dream of Ram Rajya  that \\nwe have been working day and night for the past 9 years. For the past 9 years, \\nwe have been striving to bring improvement in the life of every person in Delhi, \\nmaking efforts to bring happiness, prosperity, and a healthy life to every family. \\n \\n8. Speaker Sir, I understand that we have a long way to go in this journey to \\nestablish Ram Rajya . However, while presenting the 10th Budget of the Kejriwal \\nGovernment, I can confidently say that in the past 10 years, there have been \\nsignificant and positive changes in the lives of the common people of Delhi. The \\njourney from 2014-15 to 2024-25 has been a transformative one for Delhi and its \\nresidents. Whether it\\'s the growing economy of Delhi, the doubled per capita \\nincome, the transformation of government schools for children, the liberation of \\nwomen from battles over water tankers, the splendid infrastructure of roads and \\nflyovers in Delhi, or the provision of free hospitals and mohalla clinics for \\nimpoverished families – Delhiites have defined a journey from despair to hope. \\nWhen we interact with the people of Delhi, we receive our report card every day \\nin the form of smiles of children, women, and the elderly. However, today, before \\nthis assembly, I will also present a report card of the increasing strides towards \\nRam Rajya  in Delhi over the past 10 years. \\n \\n9. Whenever Ayodhya is described, it is said that there is no other city as beautiful \\nand prosperous as Ayodhya across the world. Today, under the leadership of \\nChief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, we are also working hard in Delhi to bring \\nprosperity as it was in Lord Ram’s Ayodhya. In the journey of establishing Ram \\nRajya in Delhi, an important indicator is the prosperity of the city of Delhi. In 2014-\\n15, Delhi\\'s GSDP was ₹ 4 lakh 95 thousand crores, and today, within ten years, \\nDelhi\\'s GSDP has reached ₹11 lakh 8 thousand crores at current prices, which is \\n2.5 times higher. In 2014-15, the per capita income in Delhi was ₹2.47 lakh and in \\n2023-24, it has increased to ₹4.62 lakh at current prices; which is approximately \\n2.5 times higher than the national average. I am pleased to inform you that Delhi \\nranks first in per capita income among states with a population of over 1 crore. \\n \\n10. In the past 9 years, both the prosperity of Delhi and its residents has increased, \\nalong with the progress of the Delhi Government. Due to a transparent \\ngovernance model, there has been consistent growth in our revenue. In the fiscal \\nyear 2014-15, the budget expenditure of the Delhi Government was Rs 30,940 \\ncrores, and in the 10th budget of the Kejriwal Government, I am presenting a 4 \\n budget of Rs 76,000 crores for the financial year 2024-25 in this assembly. Rarely \\nin the country\\'s history has there been such remarkable progress in the budget of \\nany other state. In the fiscal year 2014-15, the capital expenditure was Rs 7,430 \\ncrores. In comparison, this year the capital expenditure is Rs 15,089 crores, \\nwhich is more than double that of 2014-15. Hon. Speaker Sir, this growing budget \\nis a true indicator of Delhi\\'s prosperity because, in this budget of Rs 76,000 \\ncrores, there is not a single penny coming from the central government as a \\nshare in central taxes. \\n \\n11. Speaker Sir, it is said that in Ram Rajya,  there was no poverty, and every family \\nwas prosperous. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal believes that the only way to \\neradicate poverty is to provide good education to every child. \\n \\n \\nEDUCATION \\n \\n12. When the people of Delhi chose Shri Arvind Kejriwal as their Chief Minister in \\n2015, he made education his ‘Rajdharma’ . Over the past 9 years, through his \\nefforts, he has brought about significant changes in Delhi\\'s education system. \\n \\n13. I remember that before Shri Arvind Kejriwal became the Delhi Chief Minister, the \\nDelhi Government Schools were in a dilapidated state. As soon as one entered \\nthe school premises, they had to first bear the stench from the toilets. There was \\nno drinking water facility, windows were broken, lights were not functional, there \\nwere no desks in the classrooms, no blackboards, and no teachers. The \\ndilapidated, dark classrooms with crumbling walls gave the impression that the \\neducation of the children had been lost somewhere in darkness. Anyone sending \\ntheir child to a Government school would do so with a heavy heart, wishing they \\nhad a little more money to afford private education for their children. \\n \\n14. It felt like the fate of a three-year-old child was determined by the lines on their \\npalms. If the child was born into a wealthy family and his parents could afford the \\nexpensive fees of a private school, then his future was destined to be bright. They \\nwould get admission to good schools and colleges, graduate, and secure a well-\\npaying job. If born into a poor family, their parents would send them to a \\ndilapidated Government school, and perhaps, they might not even complete their \\nbasic education. Even if they managed to finish their studies, due to the poor \\nquality of education in Government schools, they might end up working as a \\nmechanic, a helper in a small shop, or doing household chores for someone else. \\nIn such circumstances, it was decided that the child of the rich would remain rich, \\nand the child of the poor would remain poor. This situation was completely \\ncontrary to the dream of Ram Rajya.  \\n 5 \\n 15. However, the most significant change in the evolving picture of Delhi over these \\n10 years is observed in the government schools of Delhi. The education \\nrevolution of the Kejriwal government has completely transformed Delhi \\nGovernment schools. It has changed everything. Today, a child from a poor \\nfamily or an ordinary family can achieve anything by studying in Delhi \\nGovernment schools. Just like our school children have achieved - \\n \\n● Speaker Sir, Shimpi studied at a Delhi Government School in Rohini, \\nSector 23. Her father works in a small factory. To contribute to the \\nhousehold expenses, Shimpi used to give tuition to the children in her \\nneighborhood. With the help of her school teachers, she prepared for the \\nIIT-JEE. Today, she is studying Chemical Engineering at IIT Guwahati. \\nThis means that the daughter of a factory worker now has the potential to \\nbecome a Managing Director of a factory in the future. \\n \\n● Another student Himanshu, who studied at the Nand Nagri school in Delhi, \\nalso faced very difficult circumstances. When he was in the eleventh \\ngrade, his father passed away. To support his family, he used to work after \\nschool. Due to the good education level in the Delhi Government school, \\nHimanshu cleared the NEET exam and today, he is pursuing MBBS from \\nMaulana Azad Medical College in Delhi. In the future, he will become a \\nprominent doctor in a city like Delhi. \\n \\n16. Speaker Sir, this is nothing short of a miracle. Today, children from \\nunderprivileged families are also reaching great heights. If I have to narrate the \\nstories of all the children like Shimpi and Himanshu, I am confident that we will \\nhave to then call a special session of the assembly. In just one year, 2023-24, \\naround 2121 children studying in Delhi Government schools have cleared the \\nJEE and NEET exams. Now, a poor child will not remain poor; they will become \\ndoctors, and engineers, start their own businesses, and in just one generation, lift \\ntheir families out of poverty. Speaker Sir, this is the true realization of Ram Rajya.   \\n   \\n17. Hon. Speaker Sir, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has taken several significant \\nsteps to transform Delhi\\'s education system. The first step was to increase the \\nbudget for the Education sector. Education has always been our Government\\'s \\ntop priority. That\\'s why, upon coming to power in 2015, we doubled the budget for \\neducation and consistently allocated almost one-fourth of the total budget to \\neducation for the past 10 years. In the budget of 2014-15, the expenditure on \\neducation was only Rs. 6,554 crores, and today, in the 2024-25 budget, we are \\nproposing an allocation of Rs. 16,396 crores for education. \\n \\n18. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal always says that we may construct fewer roads or \\nflyovers in Delhi, but there should never be a shortage of funds for education. 6 \\n However, the divine grace of Lord Shri Ram has been so abundant on the people \\nof Delhi, that in our Government, there has never been a shortage of funds for \\neducation or for constructing new roads and flyovers. \\n \\n19. Speaker Sir, from the time of independence until 2014-15, the Government \\nschools in Delhi had only 24,000 rooms available for the education of children. In \\njust 9 years, the Government of CM Arvind Kejriwal has built 22,711 new \\nclassrooms. Where children used to sit on the floor before, now there are colorful \\ndesigner desks-benches in the classrooms. Where there used to be broken \\nbeakers and jars in the name of labs, today there are separate, modern labs for \\neach subject - Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Computer Science. In schools \\nwhere blackboards were worn out and damaged, now every school has smart \\nclassrooms. Where stairs used to be broken, today there are magnificent lifts for \\nthe children. Today, the schools of the Delhi Government have surpassed even \\nthe private schools. The schools that used to have tents and makeshift \\narrangements have transformed into schools of talent.  \\n \\n20. After coming to power in 2015, for the first time, any Government prioritized \\nteachers. The Kejriwal Government decided to send our teachers for training to \\nthe best universities in the world. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal believed \\nthat until we provide our teachers with world-class training, we cannot offer world-\\nclass education to our children. In the past 9 years, we have sent more than 400 \\nprincipals to Cambridge and approximately 950 teachers to the renowned \\nNational Institute of Education in Singapore for training. Around 1700 principals \\nhave been sent to IIM Ahmedabad for training. And starting this year, we have \\nalso begun sending principals of Delhi Municipal Corporation schools to IIM for \\ntraining.  \\n \\n21. We worked on connecting parents with schools. Earlier parents were hesitant \\nabout going to Government schools where their children studied, and were \\nsometimes not even allowed inside the school gate. Today, schools welcome \\nthem through Mega PTM and school management committees. They are now \\nactively participating in their children\\'s education.  \\n. \\n22. Hon. Speaker Sir, in the academic year 2021-22, the Kejriwal Government \\nlaunched Schools of Specialized Excellence to provide world-class education to \\nthe children of Delhi. Under this, 38 school campuses have been established \\nacross Delhi in 56 domains, including STEM, Humanities, Performing and Visual \\nArts, and High-End 21st Century Skills. \\n \\n23. In 2014, when sending children to a Government school was a compulsion for \\nfamilies due to financial constraints, this year, there have been 140,000 \\napplications for 6,000 seats in the Schools of Specialized Excellence (SoSEs). 7 \\n The proportion in which applications are received in SoSEs (School of \\nSpecialized Excellence); is perhaps even better than India\\'s IITs. \\n \\n24. Speaker Sir, in addition to this, we have three more specialized schools - Armed \\nForces Preparatory School, Delhi Sports School, and Delhi Model Virtual School. \\nIt is a matter of great pride for us that out of the first batch of 76 students from \\nArmed Forces Preparatory School, 32 have passed the written examination of the \\nNational Defence Academy (NDA) conducted by the UPSC. \\n \\n25. In the field of education, another crucial step by Shri Arvind Kejriwal is the record \\nrecruitment of teachers and principals in schools. Before 2015, Delhi Government \\nschools had 34,182 regular teachers. Today, there are 47,914 regular teachers in \\nDelhi Government schools, and the recruitment process for approximately 7,000 \\nmore is underway. In 2023, for the first time, 324 principals were directly \\nappointed from the UPSC for Delhi Government schools, setting a record. \\nAdditionally, 389 vice-principals were promoted to the position of principal, \\nensuring that almost all schools under the Delhi Government now have regular \\nprincipals who act as school leaders.  \\n \\n26. World-class infrastructure, world-class teacher training, parental involvement, and \\nSchools of Specialized Excellence have brought Delhi Government schools at par \\nwith the most outstanding schools in the country and the world. As a result, for \\nthe past 8 years, the board exam results of Delhi Government schools have been \\nconsistently better than those of private schools every year. The outcome of this \\nis evident in the fact that in the last 3 years, more than 4 lakh children have taken \\nadmission in Delhi Government schools, forsaking private schools. \\n \\n27. Hon. Speaker Sir, the story of the Kejriwal Government\\'s education revolution in \\nthe last 9 years is not limited to just schools; it has reached the higher education \\nand technical education institutions of the Delhi Government. Sir, by 2014, the \\nnumber of students in Delhi Government\\'s 3 universities - Ambedkar University \\nDelhi, National Law University, and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University - \\nwas 71,416. In the evolving picture of Delhi over the last 10 years, it\\'s important \\nto note that the number of seats in these universities has increased to over \\n20,000. Currently, 93,880 students are pursuing their education here. Due to the \\nefforts of the Kejriwal Government in the field of technical education, the number \\nof seats has increased from 12,204 in 2014-15 to 62,000 in 2023-24. Additionally, \\nthe Kejriwal Government has started three new universities - Delhi Skills and \\nEntrepreneurship University, Delhi Teachers University, and Delhi Sports \\nUniversity. \\n \\n28. Speaker Sir, the Kejriwal Government has not only expanded the number of \\nseats and courses in the field of technical and higher education but has also 8 \\n extensively expanded infrastructure. In 2016 and 2017, two new campuses of \\nAmbedkar University were inaugurated in Karampura and Lodhi Road. In 2017, \\nthe Delhi Technological University\\'s East Delhi campus was started. Additionally, \\nin 2020, two new campuses of Netaji Subhas University of Technology were \\nestablished in Jaffarpur and Geeta Colony. In 2023, the Kejriwal Government \\ninaugurated the East Delhi campus of the IP University. \\n \\n29. Speaker Sir, over the past 10 years, the Kejriwal Government has demonstrated \\nthat with strong determination, any Government can provide world-class \\neducation and a better future for every child. If anyone has played the most \\ncrucial role in bringing about this educational revolution in Delhi, it is the former \\nDeputy Chief Minister of Delhi and my elder brother, Shri Manish Sisodia. Today, \\nin this assembly, I salute Shri Manish Sisodia’s love for children and his \\ndedication to ensuring high-quality education for all children. Perhaps, without \\nthis love and dedication, such a significant transformation in such a short time \\nwould have been impossible. \\n \\nHEALTH \\n \\n30. Speaker Sir, the second principle of Ram Rajya  is - the treatment of every ill \\nperson. There is a verse in Tulsidas ji\\'s Ramcharitmanas – \\n \\n \\n अãप मृ×यु नǑहं कव Ǔनउ पीरा। सब सुंदर सब ǒबǽज सरȣरा। \\nनǑहं दǐरġ कोउ दुखी न दȣना। नǑहं कोउ अबुध न लÍछन हȣना॥ \\n \\n31. Meaning- In Lord Shri Rama\\'s kingdom, there is a system for everyone to remain \\nhealthy and prosperous. No one dies young, and no one experiences any \\nsorrow. Everyone is beautiful and free from illness. No one is destitute, \\nsorrowful, or poor. \\n \\n32. Speaker Sir, it is a tragedy for our country that we are far from this vision. Until \\n2014, the condition of Delhi government hospitals was very poor. The hospitals \\nwere so dirty that there was no confidence among people that anyone could get \\nproper treatment there. It seemed like those who went to Government hospitals \\nwould come out with four more illnesses. Recall the scene of a Government \\nhospital - dirty floors, broken and foul-smelling toilets, soiled sheets, long queues \\nat the OPD counter with no one to answer, and no pharmacist at the medicine \\ncounter. The Government healthcare system itself was sick. If someone had a \\nlittle money, they would think of taking their family member to a private hospital \\nto save their life. The expense incurred in the treatment of a family member\\'s 9 \\n illness pushed the family into poverty. Speaker Sir, what kind of inhumane health \\nsystem is this that leaves a person so helpless that, in illness, they have to \\nchoose between their father\\'s life and their family’s ancestral property? \\n \\n33. According to the NSSO report of 2014, in Delhi, an average family had to bear \\nexpenses of up to Rs 38,000 for just one hospitalization. In 2014, the per capita \\nincome in Delhi was approximately ₹2,47,000. This means that a common family \\nin Delhi had to spend 15% of its annual income on just one hospitalization. \\n \\n34. But, the Kejriwal Government pledged that every resident of Delhi will have \\naccess to world-class healthcare, whether they are rich or poor. I am proud that \\nin the 9 years since the Kejriwal Government took office, the healthcare system \\nhas made a journey from weakness to strength, and from despair to confidence. \\n \\n35. Today, under the Delhi Government, there are 38 hospitals where treatment is \\nprovided free of cost to more than 81,000 daily OPD patients and 65,806 IPD \\npatients monthly. In 2014, Delhi\\'s Government hospitals had 9,523 beds. Now, \\nDelhi\\'s Government hospitals have 13,708 beds, enabling us to care for 1.5 \\ntimes more patients. We have extended the timings of every hospital\\'s OPD \\ncounter and provided a receptionist at each counter. Learning from global \\nstandards of patient care, we have improved cleanliness, sanitation, and \\nfacilities in every hospital. By preparing an essential drug list, we have rigorously \\nimplemented the procurement of emergency medicines in every hospital, \\nensuring that there is no shortage of medications in any hospital. \\n \\n36.  Sir, since 2017, the Kejriwal Government has initiated a new policy - under \\nwhich, if a patient in any Delhi Government hospital is unable to get a surgery \\nappointment within a month, they can opt to get their surgery done in any private \\nhospital, and the entire cost is borne by the Delhi Government. Through this \\ninitiative of the Kejriwal Government, people can now avail 1580 different types \\nof free surgeries in private hospitals also.  \\n \\n37. Until 2014, people had to wait for months to get diagnostic tests done in Delhi\\'s \\nGovernment hospitals. But today, the Kejriwal Government has changed this \\ncumbersome system. Now, not only are tests conducted in hospitals, but they \\nare also free. Today, if government hospitals are busy, the government arranges \\nthe facility of tests with private hospitals and centers. Since the inception of free \\ndiagnostic tests, the Government has gotten 5,66,000 tests conducted so far! \\n \\n38. Not only within hospitals, but the Kejriwal Government has also stood with \\nfamilies in the struggle to reach hospitals in time. In 2014, the Government had \\nabout 155 CATS ambulances; today, there are 380 CATS ambulances in Delhi. 10 \\n By increasing this fleet every year, we have brought our ambulance\\'s average \\nresponse time down from 55 minutes to just 15 minutes in the past 10 years. \\n \\n39. Speaker Sir, a person who saves someone\\'s life is called a farishta or angel; \\nthey are given the status of God. But we all know that earlier, when there were  \\nroad accidents in Delhi, the injured person would often succumb to death before \\nreaching the hospital. People were afraid to take the victim to the hospital, \\nthinking that the hospital would demand money for treatment, and they might get \\nentangled in legal issues. For this reason, when we formed Government in Delhi, \\nwe launched the \\' Farishtey Dilli Ke \\' scheme in Delhi. Under this scheme, if one \\ntakes an accident victim to the hospital, whether it\\'s a Government or private \\nhospital, the entire cost of treatment is borne by the Delhi Government. So far, \\nthis scheme has saved the lives of 22000 people. \\n \\n40. One of them is Suraj Kumar. Suraj Kumar met with a severe accident in Mayur \\nVihar Phase-1. He was admitted to a prominent private hospital where a lengthy \\ntreatment ensued, involving several surgeries. The total bill for the treatment \\namounted to 36 lakh rupees. As a factory worker, Suraj\\'s monthly salary was \\nonly a few thousand rupees. Even after investing his entire life savings, he \\ncouldn\\'t have covered such a massive bill. However, under the \\'Farishtey\\'  \\nscheme, the Government covered the entire cost of his treatment. Suraj didn\\'t \\nhave to spend even a single penny.  \\n \\n41. To save every person\\'s life is indeed the vision of Ram Rajya . Ram Rajya \\nprevails where every life is considered to be precious, and every possible effort \\nis made to protect it. \\n \\n42. Speaker Sir, the way a major illness or a major accident pushes a family into \\npoverty, similarly, even a small illness disrupts the monthly budget of a common \\nman’s family. If any member of the family gets a fever, a private doctor would \\ncharge a fee of Rs 500, provide a prescription listing medicines that costs no \\nless than Rs 500 to Rs 1000, and suggest two or three tests, each incurring a \\ncost of at least Rs 500. Just a small fever to a family member could result in an \\nexpense of Rs 2000. A typical family with a monthly income ranging from Rs \\n25,000 to 30,000 would often think twice before going to the doctor. Women \\nsuffered the most, as they often refrained from going to the doctor to save \\nmoney. Due to this, minor health issues turned into major illnesses over the \\nyears. \\n \\n43. But, I take pride in the fact that the Kejriwal Government has provided the \\ncountry with the model of Mohalla Clinics – a model where there is an AC clinic \\nwith an MBBS doctor in your neighborhood, right near your home. Here, your \\nconsultation is free, your medicines are free, and even tests are absolutely free. 11 \\n  \\n44. After making healthcare a top priority for 9 years, today I can proudly say that in \\nour efforts to materialize \"Ram Rajya\" , we have opened 530 Mohalla Clinics in \\nDelhi, where every day, 64,000 people receive free medicines, tests, and \\ntreatment. So far, Mohalla Clinics have conducted more than 7 crore OPD \\n(Outpatient Department) visits. People from across the country and abroad have \\ncome to Delhi to see the model of Mohalla Clinics, whether they are Chief \\nMinisters of Telangana or Tamil Nadu or former Secretaries-General of the \\nUnited Nations, Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon. Perhaps there is no other \\nhealthcare model that has received so much praise nationally and globally. \\n \\n45. The mention of the healthcare revolution in Delhi is incomplete without one \\nname, and that is my elder brother, Shri Satyendar Jain. Just as Lord Hanuman \\nbrought the Sanjeevani mountain in the hour of crisis, similarly, Satyendar Jain, \\nunder the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal, has revitalized the ailing healthcare \\nsystem in Delhi. On behalf of all Delhi people, I express heartfelt gratitude to Shri \\nSatyendar Jain today. \\n \\n \\nSAFETY AND DIGNITY FOR WOMEN \\n \\n46. The next core principle of Ram Rajya  is the safety and dignity of women. Ever \\nsince Shri Arvind Kejriwal became the Chief Minister of Delhi, he has worked for \\npeople of all sections of the society; however, if Arvind Kejriwal has done the \\nmost work for anyone, it is for the women of Delhi, for his mothers and sisters. As \\na woman, I am proud that today CM Arvind Kejriwal has placed women at the \\nforefront - who, for centuries, have kept everyone else’s needs in front of their \\nown. Today, as the 10th budget of the Kejriwal Government is being presented, I \\ncan confidently say that in comparison to 2014 and 2024, there has been a \\nsignificant change in the lives of women in Delhi. The Government has resolved \\ntheir daily problems and provided them with an opportunity to live a better life.  \\n \\n47. Whether it is by providing free electricity and water to alleviate the concerns of \\nwomen in the current era of inflation, or by taking the responsibility to fulfill their \\ndreams through world-class education for children. Whether it is bringing freedom \\nfrom long queues behind tankers for water, taking care of their health through \\nexcellent mohalla clinics and hospitals, or fulfilling the desire of elderly mothers to \\ngo on a pilgrimage that has been in their hearts for decades, Arvind Kejriwal has \\nworked tirelessly in all these directions, day and night, over the last 9 years. He \\nhas given every woman in Delhi the freedom to live fearlessly and independently.  \\n \\n48. Sir, after our Government was formed in 2015 I visited some Government girls\\' \\nschools - I asked the girl students how many of them had brothers studying in 12 \\n private schools. I was astonished to see that at least 95% of the girls raised their \\nhands. What did this mean? It meant that if a family had even a little money, they \\nsent their sons to private schools for a good education, while the daughters were \\nneglected and pushed towards dilapidated Government schools. But today, they \\nare receiving world-class education in Delhi Government schools. We are \\nproviding world-class education to more than 9 lakh girls in our schools. This \\nyear, 933 girls from Delhi Government schools have passed the NEET exam, and \\n123 girls have passed the JEE exam. Today, girls studying in Delhi Government \\nschools are becoming doctors, engineers, getting admission to top universities, \\nand even starting their own businesses, providing employment opportunities for \\nother women. \\n \\n49. Sir, in the year 2014-15, when a girl from a common family wanted to go to \\ncollege for her studies, her parents would refuse because the expenses for \\ntraveling were too high. Many women could not work just because the majority of \\ntheir salary was spent on traveling. But Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal gave \\nfreedom to the women of Delhi from this, so that they can contribute to the society \\nand economy. For the first time in the history of the country, in Delhi, a bus \\njourney for women was made completely free - so that a woman can travel \\nanywhere in Delhi without worrying about money and confidently, with her \\'Pink \\nTicket\\' provided by her brother - Shri Arvind Kejriwal. Now, a woman doesn\\'t have \\nto seek money from someone before leaving home. \\n \\n50. According to the figures, the number of ‘Pink Tickets’ has consistently increased \\nin the past few years. It was 17.7 crores in 2020-21 and has now reached 40.2 \\ncrores in 2022-23. In other words, approximately 11 lakh women travel for free on \\nour buses every day. From 2019 until now, in just 5 years, Arvind Kejriwal has \\nprovided women in Delhi with the freedom to travel for free on buses 153 crore \\ntimes. \\n \\n51. Speaker Sir, although Law and Order do not fall under the jurisdiction of the \\nKejriwal Government in Delhi, still, fulfilling the responsibility of an elder brother, \\nArvind Kejriwal has made several efforts to make the streets of Delhi safe. Under \\nthe Chief Minister\\'s CCTV Scheme, there are now more than 2.60 lakh CCTV \\ncameras installed in Delhi. According to Forbes India 2021 report, more than \\n1820 cameras have been installed per square mile in every part of the city. Now \\nthe figures for CCTV surveillance per square mile are such that Delhi has \\nsurpassed cities like New York and London today. \\n \\n52. According to a report by an NGO named Safety Pin, in 2014, there were around \\n7,500 dark spots in Delhi. In these areas, criminals had open opportunities to \\ncommit crimes, and a woman had to think ten times before going there. To \\neliminate this fear, the Kejriwal Government made the roads safer with 13 \\n streetlights. Until 2014, there were 66,000 streetlights on PWD roads, but today, \\non 1,400 km of PWD roads in Delhi, there are more than 87,000 lights, meaning \\nthere are more than 62 lights per kilometer. Even within colonies, 2.80 lakhs LED \\nstreet lights have been installed under the  \"Mukhyamantri Delhi Street Lights \\nScheme\" . \\n \\n53. Speaker Sir, whenever a daughter or sister in our families comes home, her elder \\nbrother or father gives her some money because they want their sister or \\ndaughter to fulfill her needs without being dependent on anyone. Today, Chief \\nMinister Arvind Kejriwal, fulfilling the duty of being an elder brother, and a son, is \\nbringing the “Mukyamantri Mahila Samman Yojna”  in the year 2024-25. Under \\nthis scheme, every woman above the age of 18 years will be eligible to receive an \\nhonorarium of Rs. 1000 per month. So, whether she is a daughter studying in \\ncollege needing extra books, a daughter preparing for a Government job needing \\ncoaching, or a woman wishing to watch a movie in a cinema hall; now, they won\\'t \\nhave to ask for money from anyone for their expenses because their brother \\nArvind Kejriwal will provide them with Rs. 1000 every month. \\n \\n54. Speaker Sir, it is written in our scriptures. Where the women are worshiped and \\nrespected; gods reside there, and where women are not honored, all the good \\ndeeds performed there become fruitless. I trust that due to the efforts made for \\nensuring women\\'s safety and dignity in Delhi, everyone will receive the blessings \\nof Lord Shri Ram. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTEERTH-YATRA FOR SENIOR CITIZENS \\n \\n55. Speaker Sir, every elderly person wishes to go on a pilgrimage after reaching \\ncertain stage of life. However, many times, despite their desire, they are unable \\nto go. There may be a lack of funds, no one to accompany them, or no one to \\nmake the necessary arrangements. But the people of Delhi are fortunate that in \\n2015, they not only got Arvind Kejriwal as their Chief Minister but also a caring \\nelder son for their families. Such a son, who has taken the responsibility of \\norganizing pilgrimage trips for every elderly person in Delhi. In 2019, the \\n“Mukhya Mantri Teerthyatra Yojna ” was launched. Under this, our pilgrimage \\ntrains go to places like Ayodhya, Mathura, Vrindavan, Rameswaram, Jagannath \\nPuri, Dwarkadhish, Tirupati Balaji, etc.  \\n \\n56. Senior citizens can go on the pilgrimage by simply filling out a form and can take \\none attendant with them. The entire arrangement is taken care of by the Delhi 14 \\n Government, whether it\\'s the AC train, accommodation, local tours, food and \\nbeverages, or any other necessary items. Today, I am proud to say that under \\nthe Mukhya Mantri Teerthyatra Yojna , more than 87,000 elderly people and their \\nfamilies have gone on pilgrimages through 92 trains since 2019. \\n \\n57. Hon. Speaker Sir, perhaps the most poignant story in the Ramayana is that of \\nShravan Kumar, who carried his blind parents on his shoulders for a pilgrimage. \\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that in today\\'s modern era, if there is a \\nShravan Kumar, it is none other than Delhi\\'s Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal. \\n \\nNO ONE SHOULD SLEEP HUNGRY  \\n \\n58. Speaker sir, it is said that in Ram Rajya , no one sleeps hungry.  \\n \\n59. In order to turn the vision of Ram Rajya  into reality, our effort is also to ensure \\nthat no person in Delhi goes hungry and gets nutritious food. To ensure food for \\nall we have implemented various schemes in Delhi.  \\n \\n60. In Delhi, there are 10,897 Anganwadi centers, through which we manage the \\nnutritional needs of 8 lakh women and children. This includes providing nutritious \\nhot meals to 1,80,000 children aged 3 to 6 years daily, nutritional supplements to \\n3,40,000 children up to 3 years, and nutritional supplements to 1,20,000 \\npregnant and lactating mothers. To prepare these hot meals and nutritional \\nsupplements, we have established 11 state-of-the-art, clean, and world-class \\nkitchens in Delhi. The menu for children has been prepared by the country\\'s top \\nnutritionists. According to this, various dishes are made for children by using \\nhigh-protein ingredients like jowar, bajra, ragi, rajma, chickpeas and lentils.  \\n \\n61. Along with this, under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, we provide nutritious meals to \\nover 20 lakh children studying in Delhi Government and MCD schools every day. \\nThese efforts in Anganwadis and schools have significantly reduced malnutrition \\nin Delhi. In 2014, nearly 2 lakh children were affected by severe and moderate \\nmalnutrition in Delhi, and today, this number has reduced significantly by upto \\n91.5%, with just 16,814 malnourished children. This is no less than a miracle. \\n \\n62. Sir, similarly the Kejriwal Government, through DUSIB, provides nutritious meals \\ntwice a day for approximately 17,000 individuals living in 198 shelter homes. \\nDuring winters, this number increases to more than 20,000.  \\n \\n63. In the financial year 2024-25, we have allocated Rs 664 crores for all the \\nnutrition-related schemes. \\n \\nHONOURING OUR MARTYRS 15 \\n  \\n64. Speaker Sir, honouring martyrs is the greatest of all deeds for an individual or \\nthe Government. The Kejriwal Government is the first in the country to provide a \\nRs 1 crore ex-gratia to the families of martyrs. Upon assuming office, Chief \\nMinister Arvind Kejriwal initiated the practice of giving a Rs 1 crore ex-gratia to \\nthe families of martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to protect the \\nnation. This initiative by the Delhi Government instills confidence in all the \\nuniformed personnel serving the country that the Government will stand with \\ntheir families even if something happens to them.  \\n \\n65. Sir, today I am going to share the stories of some brave individuals before this \\nassembly-  \\n \\n● Major Raghunath, a resident of Dwarka, was part of the third battalion of \\nthe Indian Army\\'s Parachute Regiment. Based on confidential information \\nabout a possible infiltration, on May 5, 2022, he initiated a campaign in \\nSukhdaar, Jammu and Kashmir. Unfortunately, he was martyred in a \\nmilitary operation near the Line of Control. \\n \\n● Shri Dinesh Kumar, a resident of Nangloi, was appointed as an Inspector \\nin the 205 Cobra Battalion of the CRPF. In 2013, he was seriously injured \\nin an IED blast in Chhattisgarh and remained unwell for an extended \\nperiod. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2017. \\n \\n● Speaker Sir, Praveen Kumar was posted as a fireman at the Bhorgarh \\nFire Station. During that time, a fire incident was reported in a factory \\nnear the CISF camp. While extinguishing the fire, Praveen Kumar got \\nburn injuries and succumbed to septic shock during treatment. \\n \\n66. In the past 9 years, the Kejriwal Government has provided an ex-gratia amount \\nof Rs 1 crore to families of 35 martyrs, including Late Shri Dinesh Kumar, Late \\nMajor Raghunath and Late Shri Praveen Kumar. The Kejriwal Government also \\nhonors the families of COVID front-line workers who were martyred in the line of \\nduty with an ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore each. \\n \\n67. To date, families of 92 COVID warriors who sacrificed their lives during the \\npandemic have received Chief Minister\\'s assistance and ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore \\neach. \\n \\n68. Speaker Sir, there have been brave individuals in Delhi earlier too, but no one \\never recognized their effort, and their families were never honored. However, \\nChief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has instilled confidence in the courageous Delhi \\npeople serving the country that, God forbid, if something happens to them while 16 \\n performing their duty, their Chief Minister will take care of their family in their \\nabsence. \\n \\nJUSTICE FOR ALL \\n \\n69. The next principle of Ram Rajya  is that there should be no injustice towards \\nanyone. \\n \\n70. In the narratives of the Ramayana it is said that in Ram Rajya , justice was \\navailable to everyone directly from Lord Ram\\'s court. The doors of Lord Ram\\'s \\ncourt were always open for  everyone so that he could protect his people from \\ninjustice. \\n \\n71. In today\\'s modern era, lakhs of people go to the court in the hope of getting \\njustice. But unfortunately, due to the lack of proper Judicial Infrastructure and a \\nshortage of Judges, there are approximately 5 crore pending court cases across \\nthe country, making people wait for justice for years. There is a proverb that says \\n- \"Justice Delayed is Justice Denied.\" \\n \\n72. Therefore, to ensure timely justice for the people of Delhi, the Kejriwal \\nGovernment has taken several commendable steps. In the fiscal year 2014-15, \\nthe budget for the justice system was Rs 760 crores, and I am pleased to share \\nthat today, it has increased by nearly 4 times, reaching Rs 3,098 crores. \\n \\n73. In the fiscal year 2024-25, the Kejriwal Government is going to start the \\nconstruction of four state-of-the-art court complexes in Rohini, Karkardooma, \\nShastri Park, and Rouse Avenue.  \\n \\n74. Along with establishing a robust legal infrastructure, the Kejriwal Government \\nalso provides access to lawyers for people to fight their cases. Often, an ordinary \\nperson cannot afford the expenses of lawyers, resulting in either not being able \\nto fight the case or being compelled to withdraw the case. However, through the \\nDelhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA), the Delhi Government provides \\nneedy individuals with lawyers so that they can present their side in court, and a \\nlack of funds does not become a hindrance on the path to justice. The number of \\npeople receiving free legal services through DSLSA was only 33,000 in 2016, \\nwhile during 2022-23  this figure increased almost four times, reaching 1,25,000. \\n \\n75. Before the Kejriwal Government came into power, an ordinary person had to \\nface many difficulties in Government offices. For getting a small document made \\nhe had to endure being pushed around in government offices, stand in long \\nqueues, face neglect from employees in Government offices and give bribes. 17 \\n However, through the \"Doorstep Delivery of Services\", we have completely \\nliberated the people of Delhi from the injustice happening in Government offices. \\n \\n76. Now, there is no need for people to stand in long queues or run from pillar to \\npost in Government offices to get any Government documents made. Neither \\ndoes anyone have to give bribes. Whether you need to get a driving license, \\nobtain an income certificate, register for marriage, or register construction \\nworkers, you just have to make a call to 1076 helpline. The government comes \\nto your home and gets your work done. I am pleased to inform you that since its \\ninception in the fiscal year 2018-19, more than 6.22 lakh people have received \\ndocuments through the 1076 helpline. \\n \\n \\nROZGAAR \\n \\n77. Speaker Sir, it is the failure of previous Governments that unemployment is at \\nstaggering levels in the country. Educated youth today are wandering from pillar \\nto post in search of employment. Our Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in Delhi \\nare playing a remarkable role in skill development for the youth. Currently, the \\nKejriwal Government is running 19 Industrial Training Institutes throughout the \\nnational capital. These institutes offer technical education and skill training in \\nvarious fields, including electronics, fashion designing, computer operations, \\nprogramming, and 3D modeling. Last year, over 10,000 students from these ITIs \\nsecured jobs in renowned companies such as Toyota, Maruti, Microsoft, etc. \\n \\n78. Speaker Sir, over the past 9 years, we have brought about significant changes in \\nthe process of education in our universities as well. Understanding the needs of \\nthe 21st century, we have introduced several advanced degrees and diploma \\ncourses in fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, business administration, \\ndesign, architecture, automobile engineering, and more. This is to ensure that \\nour youth are prepared from today for the future economy.  \\n \\n79. Sir, after coming to power, Shri Arvind Kejriwal established the Delhi Skill and \\nEntrepreneurship University (DSEU). Today, this university has 18,529 students \\nwho are pursuing various skill-related courses. This year, our students have also \\nreceived salary packages of up to Rs 10 lakhs! Sir, this success is not limited to \\njust one university or college. \\n \\n• In the academic year 2023-24, the placement rate of IGDTUW was \\nrecorded at 85%. This year, the highest salary package secured here was \\nRs 82 lakhs rupees. \\n 18 \\n • In 2023-24, the placement rate of IIITD was 75%. This year, the highest \\npackage offered at IIITD was Rs 49 lakhs rupees. \\n \\n• In the academic year 2023-24, the placement rate of NSUT was 75%. \\nThis year, the highest salary package at this institution has reached Rs \\n80 lakhs. \\n \\n80. Though the students studying in the Kejriwal Government’s universities are \\ngetting good jobs, it cannot be overlooked that today the country is standing \\namidst a job crisis. McKinsey\\'s 2020 Economic Report states that by 2030, India \\nwill need 9 crore non-farm jobs. From where will these new jobs come if every \\nyouth in the country continues to wait in queue for employment and keeps filling \\nout forms for one Government examination after another?  \\n \\n81. Speaker Sir, only entrepreneurship can alleviate unemployment in our country. \\nIn this direction, in 2019, we introduced an Entrepreneurship Mindset curriculum \\nin our schools. The goal is to make children so confident and capable that they \\ndon\\'t seek employment after their studies but become job creators. Under the \\npractical component of this curriculum called \\'Business Blasters,\\' students in the \\n11th and 12th grades of Delhi Government schools are given seed money of Rs \\n2000 so that they can collaborate with their peers to create a business model \\nthat can generate profit. \\n \\n82. The Business Blasters program has yielded fantastic results. Our students are \\nnot only earning money through their outstanding startups in fields such as \\nlogistics, online gaming portals, Bluetooth speakers, dark chocolate, nutritional \\nsupplements, beauty products, etc., but they are also providing jobs to many \\npeople even before graduating from school. \\n \\n83. Under this scheme, in the academic year 2023-24, around 2,40,000 students \\nformed 38,000 teams and worked on their business ideas! Moreover, for the \\nupcoming year, we have allocated a budget of Rs 40 crores to this scheme for \\nstudent startups. \\n \\n84. To further strengthen this model, the Kejriwal Government started Incubation \\nCenters in its universities, where 122 students are receiving support ranging \\nfrom mentorship by industry leaders to funding for their startups. This is aimed at \\nenabling them to create companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon of the \\nfuture, providing employment to lakhs of youth. \\n \\n85. Anant Sharma, was an ordinary student at the Kejriwal Government’s IIIT Delhi. \\nIn 2019, during his graduation days, he started a startup called \\'Tweek Labs\\' - \\nwhich harnessed a new discovery in the field of sports technology. Starting small 19 \\n at the Innovation and Incubation Center at IIITD, his company progressed so \\nmuch that Anant got a spot on the famous business reality show - Shark Tank. \\nHe presented his business pitch in front of the country\\'s most renowned \\nentrepreneurs and secured funding of Rs 60 lakhs. \\n \\n86. Anant\\'s story proves that if a talent gets support from the Government, the youth \\nstudying in Delhi or any other college across the country can change the world \\nwith their fantastic business ideas. I am delighted to announce that, drawing \\ninspiration from the entrepreneurship revolution introduced in Delhi Government \\nschools, from this year onwards, under the leadership of the Kejriwal \\nGovernment, ‘Business Blasters Senior ’ will be launched in all universities. \\nUnder Business Blasters Senior the seed money and support will be provided to \\nthe students for their startups. The Kejriwal Government will invest Rs 15 crores \\nin the start-ups of our universities this year.  \\n \\n87. Speaker Sir, I request this assembly to envision the future, thinking about Delhi\\'s \\nnext 10 years. If even 5% of the 40,000+ business ideas generated in our \\nschools prove to be successful, Delhi and the country will witness the rise of \\n2000 major companies after 10 years. These new companies will play a crucial \\nrole in eradicating unemployment and poverty from the country. \\n \\n88. Speaker Sir, this is the ideal Ram Rajya. \\n \\nLIGHTING UP EVERY HOME IN DELHI \\n \\n89. After defeating Ravana, when Lord Shri Ram returned to Ayodhya, lamps were \\nlit in every home, and Diwali was celebrated. It is said that Ram Rajya is where \\nevery house is illuminated. Today, in Delhi, people don\\'t have to wait for Diwali \\nto illuminate their homes; here, electricity is available 24*7, and every home \\nremains illuminated. \\n \\n90. Everyone would remember that long power cuts were a common occurrence in \\nDelhi. During the summer of 2014, there used to be 8 hours of power cuts in \\nDelhi, and blackouts were a regular thing. The electricity prices were also \\nsoaring. A typical family had to cut down on other expenses to pay their \\nelectricity bills. \\n \\n91. In 2014, when the residents of Delhi were struggling with power cuts and \\nexpensive electricity, the peak demand for electricity was approximately 5,800 \\nMW. However, as a result of the efforts of the Kejriwal Government over the past \\n9 years, in 2023-24, Delhi successfully met its peak power demand of 7,438 MW \\non August 22nd without any load shedding. \\n  20 \\n 92. It is nothing short of a miracle that today, the Kejriwal Government is able to  \\nprovide 24-hour electricity in Delhi, while offering the most affordable electricity \\nin the country – More than 22 lakh families receive zero electricity bills. We often \\nhear that in states where the government keeps electricity prices low, the \\ndistribution companies and their infrastructure deteriorate due to a lack of funds. \\nHowever, this is not the case in Delhi. In the January rating released by the \\ncentral government, all three Discoms (distribution companies) in Delhi received \\nan \\'A+ rating.\\' Delhi\\'s Discoms rank among the top 3 in the country, all of them \\noperate at a profit, and the people of Delhi receive free electricity. Speaker Sir, if \\nthis is not Ram Rajya , then what is? \\n \\n93. Inspired by the principles of Ram Rajya, a Government has responsibilities not \\nonly towards its people but also towards the environment. This is why the \\nKejriwal Government has not only increased the availability of electricity for the \\nwell-being of Delhi people but has also focused on green and renewable energy, \\nkeeping the environment in mind. Today, about 30% of Delhi\\'s power supply \\ncomes from green and renewable energy. Currently, 255 MW of electricity in \\nDelhi is produced from rooftop solar power plants. Solar rooftop plants are \\ninstalled on the roofs of 1280 Government buildings in Delhi, and I am delighted \\nto share that by 2024-25, every building under the Delhi Government will have \\nsolar plants on its roof. The Delhi Government aims to have solar plants on the \\nroofs of every building belonging to our Government, with a target of 4500 MW, \\nwhich is 25% of the total power supply, coming from solar energy by 2027. \\n \\n \\nWATER \\n \\n94. In the Hindu religion, it is believed that there is no greater virtuous deed than \\noffering water to a thirsty person.  \\n \\n95. Speaker Sir, water is not just a necessity; but a foundation of a dignified life. In \\n2014, in Delhi, lakhs of people had to struggle for this dignified life. Whether in \\nunauthorized colonies where water lines had not been laid for years, or in slums \\nwhere women and girls had to wake up at four in the morning to stand in long \\nqueues near their homes, waiting for tankers. They had to plead in front of \\ntanker mafias to fill water in their containers from the tanker. We often read in \\nnewspapers that there were fights and conflicts that often turned fatal, over filling \\nwater from tankers. A quarter of Delhi\\'s population used to grapple with this \\ninhumane situation every day. \\n \\n96. The Right to Water of a person cannot be determined by wealth or poverty. The \\nRight to Water is the same for a family living in the slums of Delhi\\'s Navjeevan \\nCamp as it is for a family residing in Maharani Bagh. With this vision, Chief 21 \\n Minister Arvind Kejriwal started providing 20,000 liters of free water. Today, \\napproximately 62.5% of homes in Delhi, which is around 17 lakh families, receive \\nwater completely free of cost. Not only that but after the Kejriwal Government \\ncame to power, a total of 9,34,000 homes in Delhi have received water supply \\nfor the first time. Presently, the water availability in Delhi has increased from 840 \\nMGD to 1009 MGD. \\n \\n97. Water pipelines have been laid at a war footing level in unauthorized colonies \\nand slums. There is likely no slum cluster in Delhi where water pipelines have \\nnot reached every household. Today, 99.6% of unauthorized colonies have \\nwater pipelines. In the direction of ensuring sewer facilities, there are a total of \\n4243 kilometers of sewer lines, and 1031 unauthorized colonies are now \\nconnected to the sewer network. After 2014, the Kejriwal Government has laid \\n2422 kilometers of new water pipelines and 3100 kilometers of new sewer \\npipelines, so that every Delhi resident can get the basic facilities.  \\n \\nURBAN INFRASTRUCTURE \\n \\n98. Speaker Sir, there is a detailed description of the beauty of Ayodhya in the \\nRamayana. The beauty of any modern city lies in its urban infrastructure. The \\nconstruction of new roads and flyovers in cities not only enhances their beauty \\nbut also boosts the economy of the city.  \\n \\n99. In the last 10 years, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government has developed a \\nvast network of roads and flyovers in Delhi. The Kejriwal Government has \\nconstructed 30 new corridors, flyovers, bridges, and underpasses in the past 9 \\nyears, to make traffic smoother in the city. Some of these include Bhalswa, \\nBurari, Mukundpur, and Jagatpur flyovers on Ring Road, an elevated corridor \\nbetween Madhuban Chowk and Mukarba Chowk, Signature Bridge in North-East \\nDelhi, Shastri Park-Seelampur Flyover, Ashram Chowk Underpass and Flyover \\nin South Delhi, Sarai Kale Khan Flyover, RTR Flyover on Outer Ring Road, \\nBenito Juarez Underpass, and more. \\n \\n100. The construction of these flyovers has not only reduced traffic congestion in the \\nareas but also transformed roads that used to take hours to cross into routes that \\ncan now be traversed in minutes. Until 2017-18, Delhi was the 4th most \\ncongested city in the world. Despite the increase in Delhi\\'s population and the \\nnumber of vehicles, traffic congestion on the roads has decreased. Today, with \\nthe construction of roads, corridors, and flyovers, Delhi has come down to the \\n44th position.  \\n 22 \\n 101. The Delhi Government has also focused on building internal roads that connect \\ncolonies. Under the  Mukhya Mantri Sadak Punarnirman Yojana , approximately \\n850 kilometers of roads have been constructed so far.  \\n \\n102. Providing good public transportation facilities to every resident of Delhi is the \\nresponsibility of the Government. Under the guidance of the Chief Minister, \\nsignificant improvements have been made in the public transportation sector in \\nDelhi. By March 2015, a total of 193 kilometers of metro rail network and 143 \\nmetro stations were established in Delhi. However, in the past 9 years, the Delhi \\nMetro network has doubled in length, reaching 393 kilometers, and the number \\nof stations has increased to 288. \\n \\n103. In 2014, around 24 lakh passengers used to travel daily in the Delhi Metro, and \\ntoday, more than 60 lakh passengers are using the metro everyday. The Delhi \\nMetro has now reached every corner of Delhi, whether it be Tikri Border, \\nSamaypur Badli, Tikri Kalan, Badarpur Border, or Shiv Vihar.  \\n \\n104. Not only has the metro network expanded in Delhi, but there has also been a \\nsignificant increase in the number of buses. Hon’ble Speaker Sir, I am pleased to \\nshare that with a fleet of 1650 e-buses, Delhi is now ranked third among the \\nworld\\'s cities. Today, Delhi has a remarkable fleet of 7582 buses, the highest in \\nthe history of Delhi. Additionally, the Kejriwal Government will procure 2080 nine-\\nmeter e-buses, which will be used as mohalla buses for last-mile connectivity. I \\nam pleased to inform you that by 2025, Delhi will have more than 10,000 buses, \\nout of which 80% will be electric buses. \\n \\nUNAUTHORIZED COLONIES - FACILITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE \\n \\n105. The life of Lord Shri Ram has taught us that we must think first about those who \\nare the most neglected in society. Drawing inspiration from this, Chief Minister \\nArvind Kejriwal has worked at a war footing to change the situation of \\nunauthorized colonies in Delhi. Speaker Sir, a large part of Delhi\\'s population \\nresides in unauthorized colonies. Today, there are approximately 1800 \\nunauthorized colonies in Delhi, which host 30% of Delhi’s population. There was \\na time when the attitude of Governments towards the residents of unauthorized \\ncolonies was highly indifferent, and they were left to fend for themselves. During \\nthat time, Governments only remembered them when seeking votes. There was \\nno drinking water, no roads, no sewerage, and no drains in these colonies. \\nThese colonies were surrounded by filth and garbage. Most of the inhabitants of \\nthese colonies were migrants who had come to Delhi with dreams of a better life \\nbut were compelled to live in substandard conditions. Even basic amenities were \\nlacking for them. \\n 23 \\n 106. But in 2015, when the Government of Arvind Kejriwal came to power, we \\nprioritized providing the residents of these colonies with all facilities.. We made it \\nour priority to develop infrastructure in unauthorized colonies and give people a \\ndignified life. Along with increasing drains and water lines in unauthorized \\ncolonies, the Kejriwal Government has built 5175 kilometers of roads in 1355 \\nsuch colonies. I am pleased to inform you that in the coming years, a provision of \\nRs 902 crores has been made in the budget for the upliftment of unauthorized \\ncolonies in the fiscal year 2024-25. \\n \\n107. Speaker Sir, Lord Shri Ram left everything to fulfill a promise given to Mata \\nKaikeyi by Maharaja Dasharath, and went on a 14-year exile. He lived in the \\njungles, and struggled for 14 years. Lord Shri Ram faced the challenges but \\nnever backed down from fulfilling his promise. That\\'s why it is said, \\'Raghukul \\nreet sada chali aayi, pran jaaye par vachan na jaaye.\\'  In the same way, Chief \\nMinister Arvind Kejriwal has promised the people of Delhi that he would make \\ntheir lives better, provide them with a respectable life, give their children \\nexcellent education, and ensure better health facilities. To fulfill this promise, CM \\nArvind Kejriwal has faced many difficulties. During this time, there were attempts \\nto stop the work of the people of Delhi by the opposition. Taking a cue from Lord \\nShri Ram’s life, CM Arvind Kejriwal has also fulfilled all his promises to the \\npeople of Delhi in the last 9 years, no matter how many difficulties he had to \\nface. \\n \\n108. CM Arvind Kejriwal\\'s struggle has transformed the lives of the people of Delhi. \\nNow, women don\\'t have to stand in long queues for water tankers. People living \\nin unauthorized colonies can now access basic amenities like roads, water, and \\nsewerage. Women, who were confined to their homes for years, can now step \\nout with the help of the Pink Ticket. The elderly, who had been planning \\npilgrimages for decades, can now undertake free pilgrimages through the Chief \\nMinister\\'s Tirth Yatra Yojana. Families who lost their sons at the border are \\nhonoured. Children from poor families receive excellent education, and every \\nperson has access to better healthcare. But I am proud to state that, despite all \\nobstacles, CM Arvind Kejriwal has fulfilled all his promises in the last 9 years.  \\n \\n109. I am not saying that we have done everything; there is still much more to be \\ndone. But, the work accomplished in the past 9 years, despite numerous \\nchallenges, is nothing short of a miracle. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 24 \\n [PART A] \\n \\n110. Hon’ble Speaker sir, I can say with confidence that we will continue our efforts for \\nrealizing the goal of Ram Rajya in Delhi in the coming year as well. Before \\npresenting the budget proposal for the next year, I would like to shed some light \\non the current economic scenario of Delhi. \\n \\n111. In the financial year 2023-24, Delhi\\'s Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) has \\ngrown at a rate of 9.17%, which is an increase from the previous fiscal year\\'s Rs \\n10.15 lakh crores to an estimated Rs 11.08 lakh crores this year. During the \\nfinancial year 2022-23, Delhi\\'s GSDP increased by 15.13% at current prices and \\n7.85% at constant prices. \\n \\n112. The population of Delhi contributes to only 1.55% of the total population of the \\ncountry. Yet, its contribution to the national GDP is more than double. In 2023-24, \\nthe contribution of Delhi in national GDP is going to be 3.89%, at constant prices.  \\n \\nREVISED ESTIMATES 2023-24 \\n \\n113. Speaker sir, the revised budget estimate for the financial year 2023-24 is \\nproposed to be Rs 74,900 crores. This figure is 16.83% higher than the \\nexpenditure incurred in 2022-23, which was Rs 64,110 crores. Out of the \\nproposed revised budget estimate, Rs 56,440 crores are allocated for revenue \\nexpenditure, and Rs 18,460 crores are allocated for capital expenditure. \\nEstablishment Expenditure and other committed liabilities are proposed to be \\nincreased from Rs 35,100 crore in the Approved Budget Estimate for 2023-24 to \\nRs.35,275 crores in the Revised Estimates.  \\n \\nSUPPLEMENTARY GRANTS SOUGHT FOR THE YEAR 2023-24 \\n114. Sir, the second and last batch of Supplementary Demand for Grants is Rs \\n824.86 crores in the Revised Estimates during the year 2023-24. Therefore, I \\nseek the approval of the House for the Supplementary Demands for \\nGrants..................................................................................  \\n \\n115. Now, I present the Budget Estimates for the Next Financial Year before this \\nHouse: \\nBUDGET ESTIMATES 2024-25 \\n \\n116. The Revised Budget Estimate for the year 2023-24 was Rs. 74,900 crore. I am \\npleased to announce that the proposed Budget Estimate for this year has \\nincreased to Rs.76,000 for this Financial Year 2024-25. This Budget Estimate \\nincludes Rs. 60,911 crore for Revenue Expenditure and Rs. 15,089 crore for 25 \\n Capital Expenditure.     \\n \\n117. Speaker Sir, we are all well aware of the step-motherly treatment meted out to \\nDelhi by the Central Government. All state Governments receive their share from \\nthe central pool of taxes and duties from the central Government, however, Delhi \\nhas never received its due share. While other states receive a share of 41% of all \\ntaxes collected by the Central Government, Delhi\\'s share from the central pool of \\ntaxes remained frozen at only Rs 325 crore from the year 2001-02 to 2022-23, \\nthis became zero in 2023-24. If the Central Government gives Delhi its fair share \\nin the budget, then Delhi will get more than Rs 7200 crores every year. However, \\ndespite this step-motherly treatment by the Central Government, there has been \\na historic increase in Delhi\\'s budget in the last 10 years under the leadership of \\nChief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. \\n \\n118. The proposed Budget of Rs 76,000 crore for the financial year 2024-25 is to be \\nfinanced by: \\n● Rs. 58,750 crore from Tax Revenue, \\n● Rs. 1,000 crore from non-tax revenue \\n● Rs. 10,000 crore from small savings loan \\n● Rs. 379 crore from capital receipts \\n● Nil from GST, Rs. 3,223.94 crore from centrally sponsored schemes \\n● Only Rs. 1,168 crore from Grant-in-aid of the Government of India and the \\nrest from the opening balance.  \\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT TO LOCAL BODIES \\n \\n119. Speaker Sir, no state can make progress unless its local body is strong. Keeping \\nthis in mind, the Delhi Government will provide a total financial assistance of Rs \\n8,423 crore to the local body in the budget year 2024-25. Of this, Rs 3,153 crore \\nwill be for Education, Healthcare and Sanitation. Rs 2,955 crore will be given in \\nthe form of Basic Tax Assignment (BTA) and Rs 2,315 crore will be given as \\nStamp and Registration charges and one-time parking fee. \\n \\nEDUCATION \\n \\n120. The Kejriwal Government has been continuously allocating the largest part of its \\nannual budget to the education sector. And this figure has been increasing year \\nafter year. I am happy to announce that the largest share of this year’s budget \\nhas been allocated to the education sector. \\n \\n121. Prioritizing world-class teacher training, we are allocating Rs 100 crores to \\nSCERT (State Council of Educational Research and Training) for this purpose \\nthis year. \\n 26 \\n 122. We have proposed Rs. 150 crores for the construction of new schools and \\nclassrooms and Rs. 45 crores for the maintenance of existing classrooms.  \\n \\n123. The Schools of Specialized Excellence (SoSE) is a pride of Delhi, and there are \\nplans for its expansion in all zones in the coming time. A budget of Rs. 42 crores \\nhas been proposed for SoSEs this year. The Delhi Model Virtual School (DMVS) \\nhas revolutionized the field of virtual education. Due to adverse weather \\nconditions, schools in Delhi often have to be closed. The Delhi Model Virtual \\nSchool has emerged as an excellent solution to ensure that children\\'s education \\ndoes not halt even if schools remain closed. We are proposing a budget of 12 \\ncrore for construction of a new studio, creation of infrastructure and developing \\nlearning material for DMVS.  \\n \\n124. Hon’ble Speaker Sir, the 72nd and 73rd amendments to the Constitution has \\nempowered panchayats and local bodies by giving them decision making \\npowers, thus decentralizing governance; similarly, the Right to Education Act has \\nempowered parents of children studying in schools by creation of School \\nManagement Committees (SMCs). Today, SMCs have empowered parents to \\nmake decisions concerning the school where their children are studying. Earlier, \\nwhen SMCs were not there, schools were forced to run around government \\noffices and officers for getting even small works done. This changed after SMCs \\nwere made. This year our government has allocated a budget of 40 crores for \\nSMCs.  \\n \\n125. The Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum in Delhi Government Schools, and its \\npractical component Business Blasters, has created an army of young \\nentrepreneurs in Delhi in two years. For this, a provision of Rs 40 crore has been \\nmade for the entrepreneurship development program in the Budget Estimate \\n2024-25. ..………………………………  \\n \\n126. The ‘Chief Minister Super Talented Coaching Scheme’  aids students studying in \\nGovernment schools in preparation for JEE (Main/Advanced) and NEET \\nexaminations. Under this scheme, 600 students have been selected for \\nscholarships in the financial year 2023-24. A proposed budget of Rs 6 crores is \\nallocated for this scheme in the financial year 2024-25. \\n \\n127. Hon’ble Speaker, sports are as important as education. To provide better sports \\nfacilities to our athletes in Delhi, I propose a budget of Rs 118 crores for sports \\neducation in this financial year. \\n \\n128. Speaker Sir, this year we have proposed a budget of Rs 1212 crores for higher \\neducation and technical education. This includes Rs 165 crores for Delhi Skill \\nand Entrepreneurship University, Rs 56 crores for Netaji Subhash Technical 27 \\n University, Rs 42 crores for Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research \\nUniversity, Rs 41 crores for Delhi Technical University, and Rs 92 crores for \\nAmbedkar University. Additionally, we have proposed Rs 242 crores for our \\nITIs.................................................  \\n \\n129. Sir, the Kejriwal Government is set to launch a new initiative called \"Business \\nBlasters Senior\"  in universities and ITIs to promote entrepreneurship among \\nhigher education students. I propose a budget of Rs 15 crores for this scheme in \\nthe financial year 2024-25. \\n \\n130. I am pleased to inform you that this year we are proposing a budget of Rs \\n16,396 crores for the Education sector. \\n \\nHEALTH SERVICES \\n \\n131. Speaker Sir, I propose a budget of Rs 6,215 crores for our hospitals to maintain \\ngood facilities and ensure that our hospitals remain world-class in the upcoming \\nfiscal year. In this fiscal year, we are allocating Rs 719 crores for the L.N.J.P. \\nHospital, Rs 497 crores for Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Rs 490 crores for G.B. \\nPant Hospital, Rs 352 crores for Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Rs 350 crores \\nfor Maulana Azad Medical College and Rs 291 crores for Baba Saheb Ambedkar \\nHospital. \\n \\n132. Speaker Sir, through the exemplary model of Mohalla Clinics, the Kejriwal \\nGovernment has made healthcare easily accessible for even the poorest of the \\npoor in Delhi. In this direction, I propose a budget of Rs 212 crores this year to \\nensure that the people of Delhi continue to receive excellent medical treatment \\nthrough the Mohalla Clinics. \\n \\n133. To ensure an adequate supply of essential medicines in Delhi Government \\nhospitals and to provide free medications to all those in need on time, I propose \\na budget of Rs 658 crores for this fiscal year. \\n \\n134. In this fiscal year, I propose a budget of Rs 400 crores for the construction of \\nnew hospitals and the expansion of existing hospitals through remodeling. \\n \\n135. Under the Delhi Arogya Kosh scheme of the Kejriwal Government, facilities for \\nfree treatment, surgery, radiology, diagnostic services, and medical care are \\nbeing provided. In the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, I propose an allocation \\nof Rs 80 crores to make free healthcare services available through the Delhi \\nArogya Kosh. \\n 28 \\n 136. In the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, I propose an allocation of Rs 194 \\ncrores for the purchase of new ambulances for Centralized Accident and Trauma \\nServices (CATS) in Delhi. \\n \\n137. Sir, for the financial year 2024-25, I propose a budget of 8,685 crores for the \\nhealth sector. \\n \\nPOWER \\n138. Speaker Sir, there are 58.86 lakh domestic electricity consumers in Delhi \\ncurrently, out of which 68.33% i.e. 40.22 lakh domestic electricity consumers are \\ngetting the benefits of electricity subsidy from the Kejriwal Government. In 2023, \\naround 3.41 crores zero electricity bills were issued to consumers. We will \\ncontinue this subsidy scheme this year \\nalso....................................................................................................   \\n \\n139. In order to promote the usage of solar energy in Delhi, the Kejriwal Government \\nhas proposed the “Delhi Solar Policy-2023”, which is currently in the process of \\ngazette notification. As per the Policy, any consumer who uses more than 400 \\nunits of electricity, will receive zero bills if they install adequate solar panels. The \\nGovernment will not only give subsidies for installation of solar panels but will \\nalso give money for per unit electricity production from solar \\npanels........................................  \\n \\n140. Sir, I propose a budget of Rs 3,353 crore for the power sector for the year 2024-\\n25..............................................................................................  \\n \\n \\nWATER AND SEWERAGE \\n \\n141. Speaker Sir, in the direction of ensuring the right to water and sewerage facilities \\nfor every household in Delhi, I propose a budget of Rs 7,195 crores for the Delhi \\nJal Board in the fiscal year. \\n \\nTRANSPORT \\n \\n142. Speaker Sir, Delhi has a bus fleet of 7582 buses currently, which is being used \\nby more than 41 lakh passengers on a daily basis. To expand this fleet further, a \\nConcession Agreement for the engagement of 1,900 new e-buses has been \\nsigned. I propose a budget of Rs 510 crores for electric buses during 2024-25. I \\nalso propose Rs 340 crore in 2024-25 to continue the scheme of free bus travel \\nfor women in DTC and cluster buses through ‘Pink Tickets’. \\n 29 \\n 143. Due to the constant efforts made by our Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the work \\non Phase-4 of Delhi Metro will be started soon. An MoU will be signed for the \\nconstruction of three corridors namely Janakpuri West to Ramakrishna Ashram \\nCorridor, Delhi Aerocity to Tughlakabad Station Corridor, Majlis Park to Maujpur \\nCorridor. There will be 45 stations on these three metro corridors totaling 65.20 \\nkilometers. In this financial year, I propose an outlay of Rs 500 crore for Delhi \\nMetro. \\n \\n144. In order to further improve the public transportation system of Delhi, I am \\nproposing a budget outlay of Rs 5702 crore for the financial year 2024-25.  \\n \\nLAW AND JUSTICE \\n \\n145. Sir, the Kejriwal Government is committed to provide excellent judicial \\ninfrastructure in Delhi. In this direction, we have approved the construction of 3 \\nnew court complexes, whose total cost is Rs 1,108 crore. The Government has \\nalso worked on the appointments of judges on a large scale.  \\n \\n146. A new scheme for hybrid hearings in district courts is also proposed and a share \\nof Rs 100 crore has been earmarked for this scheme in the budget estimate for \\n2024-25. \\n \\n147. I propose Rs 3,098 crores in the Budget Estimate 2024-25 for various works by \\nthe Law and Justice Department. \\n \\nROAD INFRASTRUCTURE \\n \\n148. The quality of road infrastructure is a crucial determinant of the pace of the \\neconomy of any country. The more the Government invests in roads, the more it \\nenables time and cost savings for the common people. \\n \\n149. In this direction, work of several new flyovers and elevated corridors will be \\ncompleted and dedicated to the people of Delhi in 2024-25-  \\n \\n● Barapullah Phase-III, \\n● Double Decker Metro Flyover on Brijpuri Junction via Karawal Nagar, \\nGonda, \\n● Flyover on Nand Nagari to Gagan Cinema Junction, \\n● Double Decker metro Flyover on Rani Jhansi Road Junction to Azadpur \\nCorridor, \\n● Flyover from Anand Vihar ROB to Apsara Border ROB \\n● Underpass on Outer Ring Road Mukarba Chowk \\n 30 \\n 150. Nearly 80% of the work on the integrated corridor between Punjabi Bagh flyover \\nand Raja Garden flyover has been completed. I am happy to share that by the \\nend of 2024-25, 6 new flyovers will be dedicated to the people of \\nDelhi.....................................................................................   \\n \\n151. As part of the mission to improve Delhi\\'s roads and make it one of the best in \\nterms of road networks in the world, I propose Rs 1,768 crore in the Budget \\n2024-25 for road and flyover projects in Delhi. \\nURBAN DEVELOPMENT \\n152. Speaker Sir, our Government is committed to providing basic facilities to improve \\nthe lives of 40 lakh people living in unauthorized colonies. To continue the work \\nof expansion of roads and drains in unauthorized colonies of Delhi on war \\nfooting, I propose Rs 902 crore in Budget Estimates 2024-25. \\n \\n153. Sir, our Government is implementing the \\'Strengthening and augmentation of \\ninfrastructure\\' scheme, also known as the MLALAD scheme, for maintenance of \\nRoads, Streets, Street lights etc. in each assembly constituency. Under this \\nscheme, 1,002 new projects have been approved for the year 2023-24, out of \\nwhich 717 projects have been completed. In order to continue this development \\nwork, I propose Rs 400 crore under the MLALAD scheme in the Budget Estimate \\n2024-25. \\n \\n154. Speaker Sir, under the \\'Mukhya Mantri Sadak Punarnirman Yojana’ and ‘Mukhya \\nMantri Street light Yojana’ , the condition of roads and streets of Delhi are being \\ncontinuously improved and the roads have been made safe by reducing dark \\nspots. I propose Rs 275 crores in the Budget Estimate 2024-25 for these \\nschemes. \\n \\n155. Speaker Sir, I propose Rs 9,800 crores for schemes in the Housing and Urban \\nDevelopment sector in the financial year 2024-25.  \\n \\nDEVELOPMENT OF DELHI’S VILLAGES \\n \\n156. Speaker Sir, the people living in Delhi’s villages have given a lot of love and \\nrespect to CM Arvind Kejriwal. To develop better road infrastructure in the \\nvillages, this year the Kejriwal Government will lay about 1000 kilometers of \\nroads in more than 360 villages of Delhi. This will give a great boost to the village \\neconomy. For the development of the villages of Delhi, I propose a budget of Rs \\n900 crore in the financial year 2024-25. \\n \\n \\n 31 \\n SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE \\n157. Speaker Sir, our Government is providing financial assistance to senior citizens, \\nwomen and specially abled people through various schemes. Around 9.03 lakh \\nbeneficiaries are receiving financial assistance ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs \\n2,500 every month. This includes 4 lakh senior citizens, 3.75 lakh widows and \\nwomen in distress and 1.23 lakh persons with special needs. I propose Rs 2,714 \\ncrore for these beneficiaries in the budget of 2024-25. \\n \\n158. The Kejriwal Government is bringing \\'Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana\\' for \\nthe welfare and empowerment of women from 2024-25. This will be the world\\'s \\nbiggest scheme for empowering women. Under this revolutionary scheme, every \\nwoman above 18 years of age will get an amount of Rs 1000 per month. The \\nfollowing women will not be eligible for this scheme: \\n \\n1. Who are currently a part of any Government pension scheme, or \\n2. Who \\u2060are Government employees or \\n3. Who are an income tax payer \\n \\n159. For benefiting from this scheme, any woman who is eligible will have to fill a form \\nand give a self-declaration that she is not a part of any Government scheme, is \\nnot a Government employee and is not an income tax payer. On the basis of \\nself-declaration, that woman will start getting the benefits of this scheme. Along \\nwith the form, every woman will have to provide her Aadhar card and bank \\naccount information. For the financial year 2024-25, I propose Rs 2000 crore for \\n‘Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana’.  \\n \\n160. Sir, I propose a budget outlay of Rs 6,216 crore for various schemes under the \\nSocial Welfare Department, Women and Child Development Department and \\nSC/ST/OBC Welfare Department.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 32 \\n [PART-B] \\n \\n161. Hon’ble Speaker Sir, in the first part of the budget speech, I elaborated on the \\nGovernment\\'s policies and initiatives. Now, I will discuss the efforts being made \\nto increase Government revenue. \\n \\n162. In the fiscal year 2023-24, the tax collection for GST and VAT until January 2024 \\nwitnessed a growth of 13.96% compared to the previous year (until January \\n2023), reaching Rs 31,445 crores. \\n \\n163. Speaker Sir, the Kejriwal Government has consistently worked for the \\nimprovement of businesses and traders of Delhi over the past 9 years to ensure \\nthat an honest individual is not troubled, and Government revenue continues to \\ngrow. In this direction, we have simplified regulations for businesses. Now, \\nwithout navigating through Government offices, traders can seamlessly conduct \\nall their work from the comfort of their offices through faceless services provided \\nby the Government. As a result, there has been a growth in both business and \\ntax collection in Delhi in the past years. \\n \\n164. Today, there are a total of 7.88 lakh GST taxpayers in Delhi, out of which 4.82 \\nlakh taxpayers come under the jurisdiction of the Delhi Government. The \\nremaining 3.06 lakh taxpayers come under the Central Government.  \\n \\n165. Speaker Sir, we have strengthened the audit process in Delhi. Based on Ground \\nIntelligence, Business Intelligence and Fraud Analysis (BIFA), GST Portal \\nintelligence, Delhi Government is conducting special auditing - so that tax \\nevasion can be stopped. Through the auditing process, by conducting 167 \\nspecial audits this year, a total tax deficiency of Rs 5,321 crore has been \\ndetected. On the basis of this ground intelligence, the Kejriwal government has \\nalso taken strict action against fake traders. According to intelligence reports, by \\ndoing field verification, we have suspended a total of 2911 fake firms and \\ndetected tax evasion of Rs 1316 crore. \\n \\n166. Now the next step of the Kejriwal government is to make the IT infrastructure of \\nGST state-of-the-art and the entire GST Tax Administration faceless. In this \\ndirection, our government is working on data analytics and automation software \\nin collaboration with IIT Hyderabad. This will help in tracking, monitoring and \\nsimplifying the refund process through artificial intelligence and data-analytics. \\nThis will reduce processing time and errors in files. This will help in detecting \\ndefaulters and tax evasion and taking action against them. This entire process \\nwill not only promote transparency in the system but will also eliminate corruption \\nin the Tax Administration due to it being faceless.  \\n 33 \\n 167. The Delhi Government is committed to increase excise revenue effectively. The \\ngovernment is committed to put a stop to illegal liquor trade and quality control of \\nliquor in the city through measures like Faceless Enforcement and strengthening \\nthe Excise Intelligence Bureau. \\n \\n168. The government has restored the excise duty based system from September \\n2022. The hospitality industry is making a significant contribution in improving \\nthe overall economy of the state by providing employment, tax generation and \\npromoting tourism. The government is working on developing new technology to \\nenhance and upgrade the existing technology of Liquor Supply System \\nManagement. \\n \\n169. Vehicle tax collection in the year 2023-24 (till January, 2024) stood at Rs \\n2,687.98 crore with an increase of 11.88 percent as compared to the previous \\nyear (till January, 2023). \\n \\n170. In the year 2023-24 (till January, 2024), the tax collection of stamp and \\nregistration fees (including land revenue) stood at Rs 5,797 crore, an increase of \\n16.81 percent as compared to the previous year (till January, 2023). \\n \\n171. Speaker Sir, as I conclude, I would once again like to salute Delhi Chief Minister \\nShri Arvind Kejriwal who has governed our city - for his family of 2 crore people \\nin Delhi - with the same responsibility and affection with which a person cares for \\nhis own family. He has taken care of every person of Delhi, whether it is by \\ngiving quality education to children like a father, or by sending elderly parents on \\na pilgrimage as a son, whether it is by giving Rs 1000 every month to his sister, \\nor providing a brother with good healthcare. In this journey of ten years, Shri \\nArvind Kejriwal has fulfilled all these responsibilities for his family of 2 crore \\npeople in Delhi. I am confident that the people of Delhi will always shower their \\nblessings and love on their son Arvind Kejriwal ji in his resolve to realize Ram \\nRajya. And I can say with certainty that with this love received from the people of \\nDelhi, the Kejriwal government will continue to present the budget in this \\nLegislative Assembly in the coming five years as well. \\n \\n  \\nJai Hind, Jai Bharat!  \\n \\n \\n************** '"
